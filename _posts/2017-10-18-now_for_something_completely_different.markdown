Woodworking has been an extremely fulfilling endeavor for me. My grandfather and uncle were/are accomplished carpenters, specializing in interior finish work as well as framing. Only later after college and my first few jobs did i pursue working with wood in earnest.  It started with working as a deckhand on a replica schooner in the Chesapeake Bay. The boat was built to plans from 1768 colonial America. thus began my interest in traditional wooden boats and studying any material I could get my hands on. This eventually led to turning wooden boats and wood working from a hobby to a job building boats with Bronx high school students at a non profit after school program. After the experience working in a full shop I set up my own shop in Greenpoint, Brooklyn building original designs. Along the way I also found work as a shop assistant in other's shops. After about a year, and some reflection, I came to the conclusion that although working as a freelance full time woodworker was rewarding in many ways, it just wasn't paying the bills, not to mention creating tension in my marriage. Change needed to happen. Through patient conversation with my lovely wife and other friends I looked for a career path that would pull together my varied skills and experiences.

One of the most attractive things about wookworking for me is problem solving, learning the basic forms of construction and the little tips and tricks learned from others or developed from experience, combining into a new design and form. In another life I was a geospatial analyst, using Geospatial Information Systems to update maps on a continual data maintenance project. I recall the computer engineers that were the sages and wizards, called in when things broke. they seemed to possess unreachable skill. I had learned some python in a graduate course but I usually felt very lost in a vast sea when it came to actual programming and web development.

Fast forward to the present. One of my good woodworking friends, we took a class with Roy Underhill together, works professionally as a web developer building RESTful apps. He has a great way of explaining things to a point where entry to web developer world seemed possible through hard work and practice. "Where can I get this?" I asked him. "Well there are bootcamps." he replied. So I began to look into online bootcamps to learn how to code. It seemed to be a skill that would link my interests in design, problem solving and previous experience working with geographic data!

Now I find myself working through the online bootcamp curriculum at the Flatiron School. So far it has been a positive experience through the online and in person community at the Flatiron campus in Manhattan. Even now I am writing this blog post surrounded by other students in my programming working together to learn the skills of a web developer.

Here's to the next step! In future posts I hope to share some of my learning experiences and projects along my journey. stay tuned!
